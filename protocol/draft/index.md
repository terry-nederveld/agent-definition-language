# Protocol

ADL is specified as a **family of documents** built around one signed passport. The [ADL Core specification](/spec) is the single *declarative* document: it describes what an agent **is** and the limits it **declares**. Around it sits a **protocol layer** — an open set of *procedural* documents that define what an actor **MUST do** with those declarations, the layer that gives an agent's declarations force.

Core declares; the protocols enforce. A declared limit has force only when a protocol procedure acts on it.

![Component diagram of the ADL document family. A DECLARE region at the top holds the ADL Core (identity, capabilities, limits, lifecycle), which derives the Agent Passport, a declared and signed artifact. A dashed declare-versus-enforce boundary separates it from the ENFORCE region (the protocol layer) below, holding the Trust Protocol (admission-time verification and authorization), the Runtime Protocol (a continuous governor performing enforcement and evidence), and a dashed open-layer slot for future protocols such as discovery, reputation, and settlement. The passport is consumed by the Trust Protocol at admission and by the Runtime Protocol at runtime, and is available to the open-layer slot in future. The Runtime Protocol produces an Enforcement Evidence hash-chained record.](./diagrams/document-family-architecture.svg)

*Figure 1 (informative): The ADL document family — Core declares the agent passport; the protocols enforce it (Trust at admission, Runtime continuously), with an open slot for future protocols. Illustrative only; the normative requirements live in the Core and protocol documents.*

## The protocol layer

Two protocols are defined today. The layer is open: further protocols may join it as new enforcement boundaries emerge.

| Document | Actor | When it acts | What it does |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **[Trust Protocol](/protocol/trust)** | A counterparty (peer agent, gateway, registry) | Once, at **admission** | Verifies a passport, binds a request to a presentation proof, and authorizes agent-to-agent calls. |
| **[Runtime Protocol](/protocol/runtime)** | A runtime governor | Continuously, **after admission** | Enforces an agent's declared operational limits while it executes — budgets, iteration limits, sub-agent admission, oversight triggers, degradation, and anomaly detection. |

The split mirrors the two questions governance has to answer about an agent that wasn't fully specified in advance: *can I trust this agent before I let it act?* (Trust) and *is it still behaving within its declared limits while it acts?* (Runtime).

## Status

- The **[Trust Protocol](/protocol/trust)** is drafted: authentication (§1) and authorization (§2) procedures, with conformance test vectors tracking its section numbers.
- The **[Runtime Protocol](/protocol/runtime)** is an early draft — the runtime governor (§1), the enforcement procedures (§2–§7: budgets, iteration, sub-agent admission, oversight, degradation, anomaly), and the signed enforcement-evidence format (§8) are drafted; the completeness/witness tier (§8.8) is reserved.

Each protocol is numbered and versioned independently of ADL Core. Section references outside a protocol's own range refer to the [ADL Core specification](/spec).

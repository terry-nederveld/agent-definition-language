## Overview

The Financial Profile extends ADL for financial services and banking environments. It adds members for financial data classification, transaction controls, regulatory scope declarations, and risk management. This profile addresses requirements from PCI-DSS v4.0, SOX, GLBA, Basel III/IV, FINRA, SEC regulations, DORA, MiFID II, and AML/KYC frameworks.

This profile is designed to compose with the [Governance Profile](/profiles/governance/overview). Organizations **SHOULD** declare both profiles for full enterprise financial compliance coverage.

## Use Cases

- Trade compliance monitoring agents
- AML/KYC screening agents
- Risk analysis and assessment agents
- Fraud detection systems
- Regulatory reporting agents
- Customer service agents for financial institutions
- Algorithmic trading oversight agents

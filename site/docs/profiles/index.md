# ADL Profiles

Profiles extend the core ADL specification with domain-specific requirements, members, and validation rules. They enable regulated industries and specialized use cases to build on ADL without modifying the core spec.

:::tip When to Use Profiles
Use profiles when your agents need to comply with industry regulations (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS) or organizational governance requirements. Profiles add structured compliance tracking without changing core ADL semantics.
:::

## Overview

A **profile** is a set of additional requirements and members that extend ADL for a specific domain. When an ADL document declares a profile in its `profiles` array, it:

- **MUST** satisfy all requirements of that profile
- **MAY** use members defined by the profile
- **SHOULD** be validated against profile-specific rules

Profiles are identified by URIs (e.g., `urn:adl:profile:governance:1.0`).

## Available Profiles

| Profile | Identifier | Status | Description |
|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| [Governance](/profiles/governance/overview) | `urn:adl:profile:governance:1.0` | Draft | Compliance frameworks, audit trails, enterprise governance |
| [Healthcare](/profiles/healthcare/overview) | `urn:adl:profile:healthcare:1.0` | Placeholder | HIPAA compliance, PHI handling |
| [Financial](/profiles/financial/overview) | `urn:adl:profile:financial:1.0` | Placeholder | PCI-DSS, SOX compliance |

## Profile Versioning

Profiles are versioned independently of the core ADL specification. Each profile declares which ADL versions it is compatible with.

- Profile versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- A profile version remains compatible with ADL versions it declares
- When ADL introduces breaking changes, profiles release new versions as needed

## Profile Requirements

Profiles **MUST NOT**:
- Redefine core ADL members
- Conflict with other profiles

Profiles **MAY**:
- Add new top-level members
- Add members to existing objects
- Define additional validation rules
- Require specific values for optional members

## Proposing a New Profile

1. Open an issue using the profile proposal template
2. Discuss scope, requirements, and target ADL compatibility
3. Create a directory under `profiles/` with:
   - `README.md` - Scope, status, maintainers
   - `COMPATIBILITY.md` - ADL version compatibility
   - `1.0/profile.md` - Profile specification
   - `1.0/examples/` - Example ADL documents using the profile
4. Submit a PR for review
